    "# What is the difference between a windows cmd/powershell and an Anaconda prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda command prompt is just like a windows command prompt, but it makes sure that you are able to use anaconda and conda commands from the prompt, without having to change directories or your path.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start Anaconda command prompt, you'll notice that it adds/(\"prepends\") a bunch of locations to your PATH. These locations contain commands and scripts that you can run. So as long as you're in the Anaconda command prompt, you know you can use these commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the installation of Anaconda there is a choice to *add these to the PATH* by default, and if checked you can also use these commands on the regular command prompt. But the anaconda prompt will always work.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a SHELL?\n",
    "**It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system**\n",
    "A shell is a computer program, a user interface, which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI). \n",
    "\n",
    "On most Linux systems a program called bash (which stands for Bourne Again Shell, an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, *sh*, written by Steve Bourne) acts as the shell program. Besides bash, there are other shell programs available for Linux systems. These include: *ksh, tcsh and zsh*.\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a Terminal?\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally, a computer terminal was an electronic or electromechanical hardware device used for entering data into, and displaying data from, a computer or a computing system.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ![terminal](images/F&Q_computer/univac-9400.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology improved, physical terminals is replaced with a *terminal emulator*, which is a program that emulates a video terminal within some other display architecture. And the term terminal is often used synonymously with a terminal emulator that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. \n",
    "*\"The terminal is a program that displays a graphical interface and allows you to interact with the shell.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is a Console?\n",
    "It is a window in which your text-mode programs are active. In an IDE, the console is usually used for typing in programming codes and reading results, while the terminal is used for interacting with the operating system."

The quick fix for this is to use chmod. Permissions can be set with either alphanumeric characters (the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a)) and can be assigned their access with (read (r), write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t)). Conversely, you can also use octal numbers (0-7) to change the permissions. For example, `chmod 777 my_file` will give access to everyone.\n",
