    "## 1. Binary Responses (Classification problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary dependent variables are frequently studied in applied econometrics. Because a dummy variable y can only take the values 0 and 1, its conditional expected value is equal to the conditional probability that y=1. (Conclusion drawn from Bernoulli distribution).\n",
    "\n",
    "So when we study the conditional mean, it makes sense to think about it as the probability of outcome y=1. Likewise, the predicted value $\\hat{y}$ should be thought of as a predicted probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Linear Probability Models\n",
    "\n",
    "If a dummy variable is used as the dependent variable y, and we still use the OLS method to obtain the estimators, the model is called a linear probability model, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\dots + \\beta_k x_k + u$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This model will return an unbiased and consistent estimator as long as $E(u|x)=0$. Although the estimator is no longer efficient due to heteroskedasticity. So with OLS, we should use HC standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interpretation of the coefficients is straightforward: $\\beta_j$ is a measure of the average change in probability of a \"success\" (y=1) as $x_j$ increases by one unit and the other determinants remain constant. "

    "### 1.2 Logit and Probit Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic and Probit models are designed for binary responds by restricting the probability P(y=1) (or equivalently E[y|x]) between 0 and 1. An important class of models specifies the success probability as \n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(y=1|x) = G(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\dots + \\beta_k x_k)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the \"inverse link function\" G(z) always returns values between 0 and 1. In the statistics literature, this type of models is often called generalized linear model (GLM) because a linear part $x\\beta$ shows up within the nonlinear transformation function G.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within GLM family, the most popular specifications for binary response models are\n",
    "\n",
    "- the **probit** model with $G(z)=\\Phi(z)$, the standard normal CDF and\n",
    "- the **logit** model with $G(z)=\\Lambda(z)=\\frac{e^z}{1+e^z}$, the CDF of the logistic distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation of these two models are commonly done by the **maximum likelihood** method instead of OLS. Because (1) maximum likelihood is more intuitive when it comes to probabilities, and (2) the well-known formulas for OLS estimates need to be modified in the case of nonlinear relationships."
