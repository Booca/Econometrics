    "# What is \\$PATH?\n",
    "PATH is an environment variable on Unix-like operating systems, DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, specifying a set of directories where executable programs are located. When a command name is specified by the user or an execution call is made from a program, the system searches through PATH, examining **each directory** from left to right in the list, looking for a filename that matches the command name. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when the terminal throws an error saying \"\", you can first try to add the directory of the executable to PATH.\n",

    "The PATH variable makes it easy to run commonly used programs located in their own folders. If used unwisely, however, the value of the PATH variable can slow down the operating system by searching too many locations, or invalid locations."
